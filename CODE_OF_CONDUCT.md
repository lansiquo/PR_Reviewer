## Code of Conduct

We commit to a harassment-free, inclusive experience for contributors and users.
Be respectful. Assume good intent. No harassment or personal attacks.

For severe or repeating issues, contact maintainers via Issues or email;
we may warn or remove participants to maintain a healthy community.

(You can replace this with the full Contributor Covenant later if desired.)
